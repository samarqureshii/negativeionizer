#### Over a billion people, like myself, have to live with respiratory ailments aggrivated by poor air quality. 

Devices such as negative ionizers have been proven to cancel the effects of airborne pathogens such as COVID-19. Nonetheless, negative ionizer devices arenâ€™t always efficient, as they require a lot of power and arenâ€™t efficient in large spaces. 
I set out to solve this problem by building a 3 wheeled motorized, fully autonomous indoor robot equipped with an ionizer, air quality sensors, and ultrasonic obstacle detection. An Arduino Uno was programmed to read a room's air quality and identify where air quality was poor, allowing the ionizer to do its job.

This cost-effective, low-power device brought air quality from harmful levels to safe breathing in a shorter timeframe than if the ionizer was stationary. This robot has potential for industrial and healthcare spaces that require constant air quality monitoring and sanitization.
